bug zoom can't be zero
position random cubes on random tiles
increase varaince on random board

enforce landscape (with/height>1) for window


further: gamification

implement "shade planes": totaly dark. light can be made by shooting it's a ray that spans the while plane and fades over time
the texture of the plane can be chosen by the player and can only be seen of lit up.


only lock a player in a cube if the cube is lower than, yours
the image for both shade planes can be chosen by the user-> could be tactical advantage
let the user create it's own V8^3 (3D 8x8 matrix) as avatar, implement shooting and camera height accordingly
increase the width of the rotation bound with increasing abs fraction of position
until rotation is instant
