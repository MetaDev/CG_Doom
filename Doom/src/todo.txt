implement texture
impelement light
implement cube shooter
implement board navaigatino, in tile movement tile teleportation, implement cube walking with bounds

divide camera and player transformation matrices

scale view by tile size

make rotation and movement smooth (lerp)

enforce landscape (with/height>1) for window
walk slower on bigger tiles (same crossover time)

update cubes method that reloads all cubes

implement "shade planes": totaly dark. light can be made by shooting it's a ray that spans the while plane and fades over time
the texture of the plane can be chosen by the player and can only be seen of lit up.

render textures

 only lock a player in a cube if the cube is lower than, yours
the image for both shade planes can be chosen by the user-> could be tactical advantage
let the user create it's own V8^3 (3D 8x8 matrix) as avatar, implement shooting and camera height accordingly
increase the width of the rotation bound with increasing abs fraction of position
until rotation is instant
